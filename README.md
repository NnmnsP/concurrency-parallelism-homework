## Task 1
Calculate the sum of prime numbers up to N (which can be millions) using Euclidean test and split the calculation between tasks based on the number of cores. Test on different types of pool (Thread and Process) and monitor CPU load.

## Task 2
Compress all images in a folder using the Pillow library, reducing size by half and quality to 50. Test on a folder with 20-30 jpeg images of size 1-10Mb. Overwrite images, but keep a copy of the originals. Compare the timing for threads and processes and explain their behavior.
